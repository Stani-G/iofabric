# Our Engineering Philosophy

Every project has different requirements and principles. This should result in a different engineering philosophy per project, with each philosophy focusing on what really matters for the project at hand. Whether or not this happens on other projects, it is happening here.

In order to contribute to ioFabric, you must buy into this engineering philosophy entirely.

###Philosophy Statements (in no particular order)

* We use the minimal amount of code for the job
* We believe that nobody will ever reuse our classes so we code for our own efficiency
* We comment code well enough that we don't have to read the code to know what it does
* We use the simplest and most direct approach for every task
* We keep the number of dependencies to an absolute minimum
* We write very protective code that handles all exception types instead of throwing errors
* We avoid writing any build tool dependencies into the actual code base
* We write great tests and unit tests
* We choose to write fast executing code over code that's easy to write and maintain
